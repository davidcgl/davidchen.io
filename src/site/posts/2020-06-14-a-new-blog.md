title: A new blog
subtitle: My short history with blogging, and my attempt to start writing again.
---

I started my first blog around 2005. It was during the heyday of [Blogger][0]
and [Windows Live Spaces][1]. Wordpress was around too, but it wasn't as
popular among my friends.

My motivation at the time was to improve my English (my second language). I
admired bloggers who had a strong command of English, and would try to emulate
their style using words I didn't understand.

Like many high schoolers, I mostly wrote about relationships and school. As I
entered college, I began to find my blog embarassing. _So immature!_ So I
stopped blogging and deleted everything.

I've been on a writing hiatus since then. I wish I hadn't deleted my old
blog --- it'd be an interesting memory lane to walk down.

## Why I started a new blog

I made this blog on a whim to learn [Eleventy][7], not because I felt an urge
to write again. But as I reflect on why I should write more, two reasons stand
out: **embracing my fear**, and **organizing my thoughts**.  

I've always been curious, and slightly terrified, of how other people might
judge me. The fear of judgement followed me into adulthood, and led to my
reluctance to publicize my work. I don't think this is a healthy trait to keep.

There are also many good reasons to write. I especially like [these][2]
[posts][3] by Nathan Marz, which I've read years ago but never acted on. In
particular, these paragraphs resonated with me:

> Writing reveals holes in your thinking. When your ideas are written and
> looking back at you, they're a lot less convincing than when they're just in
> your head. Writing forces you to mature your ideas by thinking through
> counterarguments.
>
> Writing helps you organize your thoughts in a coherent way. This makes
> you a much better conversationalist when these topics come up. I can't count
> the number of times I've had deeper conversations with people because I had
> matured my ideas offline.
>

I'm sure many prolific writers in the tech industry, like [Paul Graham][4] and
[patio11][5], have made similar remarks, or would be in agreement.

## What I might write about

I'll focus on my work and interests.

I work in tech, and naturally spend a lot of time on programming. I often come
across nifty programing tips on someone's blog. They've helped solve many
problems at work.

For example, I recently read about using [git-commit-graph][6] to speed up
`git log --graph` from a short blog post. It immensely improved my
productivity.

I'll start with posts like that. I hope they get some hits on Google, and help
other software apprentices like they did for me. I'll also write about things I
learned (e.g. how I built this website), and maybe an occasional rant about the
tech industry.

Will I be able to keep up the commitment, or will this blog die a slow death?
Who knows? Only time will tell!
