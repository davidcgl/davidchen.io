title: New blog
subtitle: My short history with blogging, and my attempt to start a new blog.
---

I started blogging around 2005, during the heyday of [Blogger][0] and [Windows
Live Spaces][1]. Like many high schoolers, I wrote mostly about relationships
and school.

My motivation at the time was to improve my English (my second language). I
respected bloggers who had a strong command in English, and would try to
emulate their style using complicated words I didn't understand.

As years went by, I began to find my old posts embarassing. So I stopped
blogging and deleted everything. I really wish I hadn't --- it'd be an
interesting memory lane to walk down.

## Why I started a new blog

I've always been curious, and slightly terrified, of how other people judge me.
The fear of judgement followed me into adulthood, and led to my reluctance to
publicize my opinions and work. I don't think this is a healthy trait to
maintain.

There are many good reasons to write. I especially like with these posts by
Nathan Marz, which I've read many years ago but never took action on:

1. [You should blog even if you have no readers][2]
2. [Break into Silicon Valley with a blog][3]

In particular, these paragraphs resonated with me:

> Writing reveals holes in your thinking. When your ideas are written and
> looking back at you, they're a lot less convincing than when they're just in
> your head. Writing forces you to mature your ideas by thinking through
> counterarguments.
>
> Writing helps you organize your thoughts in a coherent way. This makes you a
> much better conversationalist when these topics come up. I can't count the
> number of times I've had deeper conversations with people because I had
> matured my ideas offline.

I'm positive that many great writers in the tech industry, like [Paul
Graham][4] and [patio11][5], have made similar arguments, or would be in
agreement.

## What I might write about

I'll focus on things related to my work and interests.

I work in tech, and spend a lot of time on programming. I often come across a
nifty trick I never know existed, usually from Stack Overflow or some
engineer's blog. These tips have helped solve many problems at work. For
example, I recently learned how to use [git-commit-graph][6] to speed up
`git log --graph`.

I'll start with posts like that. I hope they get some hits on Google, and help
other software apprentices like they did for me. I'll probably also write about
things I learned (e.g. how I built this blog using [Eleventy][7]), and maybe an
occasional rant about the tech industry.

Will I be able to keep up the commitment, or will this blog die a slow death?
Who knows? Only time will tell!
