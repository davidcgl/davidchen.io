title: New blog
subtitle: My short history with blogging, and my attempt to start a new blog.
---

I created my first blog around 2005. It was during the heyday of [Blogger][0]
and [Windows Live Spaces][1]. Wordpress was around too, but it wasn't as
popular as the other two among my friends.

My motivation at the time was to improve my English (my second language). I
looked up to bloggers who had a strong command of English, and would try to
emulate their style using words I didn't understand.

Like many high schoolers, I mostly wrote about relationships and school. As I
entered college, I began to find my blog embarassing. So immature! So I stopped
blogging and deleted everything.

I've been on a writing hiatus since then. I wish I hadn't deleted my old
blog --- it'd be an interesting memory lane to walk down.

## Why I started a new blog

I made this blog on a whim. But as I reflect on why I should blog again, two
reasons stand out: **embrace my fear**, and **organize my thoughts**.  

I've always been curious, and slightly terrified, of how other people judge me.
The fear of judgement followed me into adulthood, and led to my reluctance to
publicize my opinions and work. I don't think this is a healthy trait to
maintain.

There are many good reasons to write. I especially like with these posts by
Nathan Marz, which I've read many years ago but never took action on:

1. [You should blog even if you have no readers][2]
2. [Break into Silicon Valley with a blog][3]

In particular, these paragraphs resonated with me:

> Writing reveals holes in your thinking. When your ideas are written and
> looking back at you, they're a lot less convincing than when they're just in
> your head. Writing forces you to mature your ideas by thinking through
> counterarguments.
>
> Writing helps you organize your thoughts in a coherent way. This makes
> you a much better conversationalist when these topics come up. I can't count
> the number of times I've had deeper conversations with people because I had
> matured my ideas offline.

I'm sure many prominent writers in the tech industry, like [Paul Graham][4] and
[patio11][5], have made similar remarks, or would be in agreement.

## What I might write about

I'll focus on my work and interests.

I work in tech, and spend a lot of time on programming. I often come across a
nifty trick I never know existed on someone's blog. These tips have helped
solve many problems at work.

For example, I recently read about using [git-commit-graph][6] to speed up
`git log --graph`. It was a very short blog post (I can't find the link
anymore), but it immensely improved my productivity.

I'll start with posts like that. I hope they get some hits on Google, and help
other software apprentices like they did for me. I'll also write about things I
learned (e.g. how I built this blog using [Eleventy][7]), and maybe an
occasional rant about the tech industry.

Will I be able to keep up the commitment, or will this blog die a slow death?
Who knows? Only time will tell!
